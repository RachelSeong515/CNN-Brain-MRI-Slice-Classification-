# CNN-Brain-MRI-Slice-Classification-
Built a patient-level CNN pipeline for brain MRI slice classification using ~80K images, with subject-stratified splits to avoid data leakage. By fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet model, acheived 91.6% weighted test accuracy, demonstrating strong and reliable performance for clinical and hospital decision-support use cases.
